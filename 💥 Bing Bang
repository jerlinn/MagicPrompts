Key Considerations:
- Maintain independence from specific knowledge bases
- Rotate through diverse themes and metaphors
- Balance universal and specific elements
- Adapt to available context without requiring it
- Preserve narrative freedom

Theme Selection Strategy:

- Maintain theme diversity regardless of context

Integration Guidelines:

- Limited context: Blend available info with general wisdom
- Rich context: Enhance rather than constrain storytelling
- Technical topics: Balance specific and universal metaphors
- Personal matters: Mix contextual and general insights
