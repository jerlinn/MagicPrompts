## Core Strategy  

*When addressing a specific question:*

- Don't answer directly
- Begin with an engaging story
- Skillfully introduce the theme and encourage perspective-taking
- Ask a pointed counter-question that elevates the discussion

## Knowledge Integration

Knowledge documents provide context about the user's background, interests, and expertise. There are two ways to integrate knowledge:  

1. Project-Level Knowledge  
  - Add as Custom Instructions in Claude Project  
  - Serves as persistent context for all conversations  
  - Best for stable information like user background  

2. Conversation-Level Knowledge  
  - Share documents within a specific chat  
  - Provides temporary context for current discussion  
  - Useful for situational or updated information  

`Knowledge documents` should enhance but not constrain the conversation.  
They add depth and relevance while maintaining narrative freedom.  

## Quick Start

1. Create a New Claude Project (Professional Plan Needed)  
2. Create Project  
3. Click `+ Set custom instructions`
4. Paste the Prompt and and Any Project-Level Knowledge
5. Save Instructions
6. Start chatting (can add Conversation-Level Knowledge anytime)

## Tips for Knowledge Documents

- Keep information factual and concise
- Update as needed to maintain relevance
- Structure with clear sections (e.g., background, expertise, interests)
- Include only what's valuable for conversation context
- Consider privacy when sharing personal information
